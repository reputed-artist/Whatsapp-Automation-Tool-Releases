# 📱 Whatsapp Automation Tool

A PyQt-based desktop application that automates sending WhatsApp messages **just like a human would** — by moving the mouse cursor and interacting with **WhatsApp Web**.  
No WhatsApp API is used, making it fully **legal** and compliant, since all actions involve real **human-like interactions**.
